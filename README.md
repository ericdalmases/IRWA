# Tweet Data Analysis in Google Collab

```
Welcome to the Tweet Data Analysis project! This repository contains Python code for analyzing tweet data within a Google Colab notebook. Follow these step-by-step instructions to execute the code successfully and customize your analysis options.

The procedure for executing the code is the same for all the deliverables of the project so far.

**Getting Started**

1. **Access Google Colab:**

Begin by opening Google Colab.

2. **Open the Notebook:**

In this repository, you will find a Jupyter notebook. Open it by saving it to your drive and simply clicking on the notebook file.

**Configuring Your Data**

1. **Customize Data Paths:**

Make the code work with your data by configuring the file paths. Replace the default paths in the code with your own. You need to specify the path to your data location and the destination path for saving any generated images. Modify the following lines within the notebook:

data\_path = '/content/drive/…'

plt.savefig("/content/drive/…/WordCloud1.jpg")

plt.savefig("/content/drive/…/WordCloud2.jpg")

# ...

plt.savefig("/content/drive/…/tokernsxtweet.jpg", bbox\_inches='tight')

# …

Take into account that depending on the deliverable the data path might change, so be careful to modify them all!

**Running the Analysis**

1. **Mount Your Google Drive:**

Execute the first code cell in your notebook to mount your Google Drive. This step is necessary to access and save files.

2. **Execute Code Cells sequentially:**

Run the code cells one by one by clicking the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter. Running the cells in the notebook in the specified order is crucial because certain cells rely on the output of previous ones.

3. **Viewing Visualizations:**

Visualizations, such as word clouds and graphs, will be displayed within the notebook as specified in the code.

**Accessing Your Results**

1. **Accessing Generated Files:**

Any files or data generated during the analysis will be saved in your Google Drive and made accessible within the notebook.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly run the provided code for tweet data analysis in Google Colab while tailoring it to your specific data and preferences.
